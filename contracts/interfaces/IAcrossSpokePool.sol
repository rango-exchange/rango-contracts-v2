     * @param originToken Token to lock into this contract to initiate deposit.
     * @param amount Amount of tokens to deposit. Will be amount of tokens to receive less fees.
     * @param destinationChainId Denotes network where user will receive funds from SpokePool by a relayer.
     * @param relayerFeePct % of deposit amount taken out to incentivize a fast relayer.

     * to LP pool on HubPool.

     * Note: this is intended to be used to pass along instructions for how a contract should use or allocate the tokens.

     * exist, then the relayer will not be able to fill any relay, so the caller should validate that the depositor
     * did in fact submit a relay.

     * @param updatedRecipient New recipient address that should receive the tokens.
     * @param updatedMessage New message that should be provided to the recipient.
     * @param depositorSignature Signed message containing the depositor address, this contract chain ID, the updated
     * relayer fee %, and the deposit ID. This signature is produced by signing a hash of data according to the
